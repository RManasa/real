<p><b>Question 1: Why did dinosaurs become extinct? A consensus of scientific opinion says it was because of a metorite impact 65 million years ago. Seems to me SOME would have survived. </b></p>
<p>Answer 1: Some did. 65 million years is a long time to evolve into the lizards and birds we see today.
<p>Answer 2 : Because behimoths (dinosaure as a word was coined in 1849) are mentioned in the Bible it could also be they died in the Noahanic Flood.
<p>Answer 3: Surely they did? There are lots of animals around today which are descendents from dinosaurs.. birds, lizards etc.
<p>Answer 4: The tuatara is considered to be from the oldest living line of dinosaurs.
